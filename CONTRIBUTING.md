# How to contribute
Firstly - thank you for contributing to Astra! :+1::+1::+1:

Here are some important resources:
* [The Wiki](https://github.com/alfasoftware/astra/wiki) - our instructions on how to get started.
* [Issues](https://github.com/alfasoftware/astra/issues) - our list of known issues.

# How to contribute code
Please raise a [GitHub Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) with a clear description of your changes:
* If applicable, please include the relevant issue number.
* If updating a refactor, please use Astra's [test framework](https://github.com/alfasoftware/astra/wiki/Start-with-tests!) to add test coverage.
There's no need to make any versioning changes in contributions - we work in snapshot, and releases are handled at appropriate milestones by the project maintainers.

# How to contribute issues
Please raise the issue as a [GitHub issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) (if one hasn't already been raised!) explaining the problem and providing details to help with reproduction:
* **A clear and descriptive title**
* **The exact steps which reproduce the problem**. The more details the better! 
* **Provide specific examples**. This can be in any form, but ideally would be written as a unit test using Astra's [test framework](https://github.com/alfasoftware/astra/wiki/Start-with-tests!) - then reproducing the issue is as simple as running the test!

Thank you!

Team Astra :milky_way:
